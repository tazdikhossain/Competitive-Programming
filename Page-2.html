        Memory Limit:

        In Competitive programming everything we write is a text.

        every line of code is a text and for every line of code the Memory
        allocation is rising.

        A given problem can be solved in many ways.
        And in Competitive programming the shortest path or the most limited line is the required one.
        
        In a contest if the problem is solved in the limited time addition 
        then it is the right answer.
